      <p>"Emotional Hotspots is a work created in response to the Manchester International Festival's, <a href="mif.co.uk/mif17-events/what-is-the-city-but-the-people/">"What Is The City But The People."</a> The opening event of MIF brought together friends, neighbours and total strangers to serve as a self-portrait of the city.</p>

      <p>I reimagined the idea of the city's self-portrait, as an emotional composition. We all have emotions and the places we've had them, are memorable</p>

      <p>I performed guerrilla research and conducted a survey to ask loved ones and strangers about their own emotional memories. Using the Google Maps API, I created a heat map of where people feel the most.</p>

      <p>I wanted to create this work to indicate our sameness and our ability to unify. Underneath our differences, we feel the same.</p>
